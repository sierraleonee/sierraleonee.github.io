  I'm a freshman at Towers High School. I take Spanish, Health, Intro to Software Technology, and American Government classes. I don't want to go to college, I
  want to have own online buisness, like lips gloss, bracklets, arts and crafts kind of things. But who knows what the future will bring to me. I'm just takng
  life day by day.

  I like to write and paint in my free time. I usually only write at school or if i'm doing something important. I haven't painted in a couple of months since 
  school started back. I do like to write short essays and stories.
