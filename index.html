  I'm a freshman at Towers High School. I take Spanish, Health, Intro to Software Technology, and American Government classes. I don't want to go to college, I
  want to have own online buisness, like lips gloss, bracklets, arts and crafts kind of things.

  I like to write and paint in my free time. I usually only write at school or if i'm doing something important. I haven't painted in a couple of months since 
  school started back. I do like to write short essays and stories.
